Step 1: Enable USB Debugging in your phone.

Step 2: Download ADB Utilities from Android SDK Tools - Platform Tools
    -> https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools

Step 3: Open command line and connect your mobile with your PC using a wire.

Step 4: Navigate to the extracted platform-tools folder.

Step 5: type "adb devices"
    -> If you have properly set up the USB Debugging and allowed permissions then it will show a device as connected

Step 6: type "adb shell",  If you wish to exit type "exit" inside the shell

Step 7: type "pm list packages"
    -> It will show a list of packages installed in your device,
    Eg : package:com.xiaomi.mipicks

Step 8: Extract just the package name and execute this command
    -> pm uninstall -k --user 0 {some_package_name}
    Eg:
    pm uninstall -k --user 0 com.xiaomi.mipicks
    pm uninstall -k --user 0 com.android.browser
    pm uninstall -k --user 0 com.miui.videoplayer
    pm uninstall -k --user 0 com.miui.player

    This command will keep the data of the app (with "-k").

    It will only remove the app from your user and not from the device.("--user 0", 0 is the default/current user)
    A factory reset will bring them all back.
